Destiny Character Management Console
================================
The Destiny character manager provides an easy-to-use interface for you to manage your Destiny inventory. It automates the process of moving weapons and other inventory items between characters without requiring you to enter the in-game Tower to manage your gear. This lets you keep all your favorite things close at hand, while keeping unwanted items out of sight. We can maintain inventories of any size, with anywhere from one to three characters.

## Quick-start

### Installation and setup
**TODO**

### Usage
Right now, our app has a command-line interface for managing gear. To access the console, start the program as described above. We will load information about your characters and vault from Destiny servers automatically, and then load the console when we're ready. You'll see some preliminary messages that are printed as the data is loaded.

    Loading inventory data... this could take a few seconds
